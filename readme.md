#Ars Magica 2 - Rework 1.9.4

This is a reworked version of the Ars Magica 2 mod by Mithion.

This version is focused on the API, allowing modders to add AM2-related content in a simple way.

I'd say i'm 60-65% done with this update

##Currently in the API
-Affinities
-Abilities
-Imbuements
-Spell Parts (Shapes, Component, Modifier)
-Flickers
-Skills
-Crafting Altar Materials
